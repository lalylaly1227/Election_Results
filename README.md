# Election_Results
Module 3 - Phython

## Program Overview
We needed to act as a Board of Elections employee and complete the following tasks as part of an election audit in the local congressional election.

1. Calculate total number of votes cast.
2. Compile a list of the candidates that received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the % of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Summary
The audit analysis of the election demonstrates the following:
- There was a total of 369,711 votes cast
- There were three candidates:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- There were three counties:
  - Jeffersen
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe
- The election results were as follows:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 with total votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 with total votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 with total votes
- The winner of the elections based on the audit/anaylis was:
  - Diana DeGette
  - Vote Count: 272,892
  - Percentage: 73.8%
- The county with the largest number of votes was:
  - Denver

## Challenge Overview
Lots of steps to complete.  Needed to be extra organized and pay close attention to details.  Making sure I coded correctly and without any suntax errors.  Also had to run the files various times, make corrections and look for missing items.  Towards the end I was only getting one of the candidates to populate, then after much trials and error, found I was missing the For Loop statement to make the file run accurately and get the desired output. Expaning the election audit to incluse voter turnout by county represented a challening ordeal.  The main issue I had, was naming the new variables correctly and using them accordingly throughout the code. I tried different names until I was ale to use one that I could easily understand what it was for. The beauty of this code is that it could be used for other election audits where the csv file used the same headers without changing anything else in the code.

## Challenge Summary
This challenged helped learn about basic codes, like how to read a csv file and how to write to a txt file. It reinforced the For Loop statesments, how to count and tally totals.  How to skip a line in the list with the next statement.
