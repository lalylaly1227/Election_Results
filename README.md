# Election_Results
Module 3 - Phython

## Program Overview
We needed to act as a Board of Elections employee and complete the following tasks as part of an election audit in the local congressional election.

1. Calculate total number of votes cast.
2. Compile a list of the candidates that received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the % of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Summary
The audit analysis of the election demonstrates the following:
- There was a total of 369,711 votes cast
- There were three candidates:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The election results were as follows:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 with total votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 with total votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 with total votes
- The winner of the elctions based on the audit/anaylis was:
  - Diana DeGette
  - Vote Count: 272,892
  - Percentage: 73.8%

## Challenge Overview
Lots of steps to complete.  Needed to be extra organized and pay close attention to details.  Making sure I coded correctly and without any suntax errors.  Also had to run the files various times, make corrections and look for missing items.  Towards the end I was only getting one of the candidates to populate, then after much trials and error, found I was missing the For Loop statement to make the file run accurately and get the desired output.

## Challenge Summary
This challenged helped learn about basic codes, like how to read a csv file and how to write to a txt file. It reinforced the For Loop statesments, how to count and tally totals.  How to skip a line in the list with the next statement.
